# James McDougall
I'm going to hold all my resumes in this repository. I'll try to include my entire work and project history here eventually.
The current copy of my resume will be available in this README as a png and older copies will be in the repository. PDFs of all my resume iterations will be in the repo so be sure if you download a pdf it is the most up to date one.
